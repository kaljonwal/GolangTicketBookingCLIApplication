Notes for go:
    1. Variable names must be used
    2. Imported package must be used
    3. if you decalare a constant then it is not necessary to use that constant name

Go is a statically typed language
    you'll need to tell compiler, the data type when declaring variable else you'll get error
    Go can imply the type based on value
    Values will be validated at compile time only lets say if you are using negative
